----------------
The idea of the project is to use astronomical data like: Dispersion measure, and Observed redshift(z), from which DM_Milky was has been calculated; and find the Hubble constant H0.
This has been done by approximating DM_host by a Gaussian, with known mean, and using a formula of DM_LSS which is implicitly dependent on H0.
